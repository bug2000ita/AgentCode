# Terminal Games

This project contains simple terminal games written in Python.

## Installation

On Unix-like systems no extra dependencies are required. Windows users
need the `windows-curses` package:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Use `menu.py` to choose which game to play:

```bash
python menu.py
```

You can pick between the classic Snake game and a minimal Doom-like
first-person demo. Press `q` to exit a running game.
